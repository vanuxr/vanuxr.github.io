Last week, many UX professionals and students joined the skill-building workshop lead by [Matthias Klenk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-klenk/) and [Lavanya Ashok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lavanyaashokkumar/), and learned about user interviews and mindsets, and tried them out in 15 minute sessions with “coach” volunteers. The attendees worked in groups of 3-4 to come up with a semi-structured interview script and took turns interviewing a “user”, who turned into a “coach” at the end to give them feedback on what went well and what could use improvements. The interactions among seasoned people who practice research, and attendees, made this a fun and engaging experience. (The coaches also thought it was fun being on “the other side” for a change!) The groups came together again in the end and shared observations and learning to everyone. This marks a great first-time collaboration event by [Vancouver Design Check-In](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vancouver-design-check-in/) and VanUXR meetup.

We have compiled a list of resources that goes beyond conducting the user interviews:
