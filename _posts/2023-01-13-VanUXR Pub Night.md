Happy new year, VanUXR Folks! We are meeting for a casual pub night, to share insights and experiences over a few drinks/food. Whether you're feeling energized about the new possibilities this year, or need to take a break from the screen to unwind, come through!

The location is at [Strathconahcona Brewing Company](https://www.strathconabeer.com/), where we reserved a long table for us to chat and mingle. If we have more signup than they can accommodate, we may change locations.

This is a great opportunity to meet and connect locally with other UX researchers and people who do research, share stories from the field, and exchange ideas on what youâ€™re looking forward to this year. There will also be some conversation card games ([100 Questions: Work Edition](https://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/100-questions-work-edition/), [Where Should We Begin - A Game of Story](https://game.estherperel.com/)) at the table, to help us channel our curiosity and create a sense of play.

Come enjoy a fun evening of conversation and camaraderie with your fellow UX researchers. Whether you are a seasoned pro or just starting out, all are welcome. We look forward to seeing you there and raising a glass to all of our hard work!
