From the months of July to September, the meetup group read [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-book-sale/) by Donnela Meadows, and gathered to share insights from the reading experience. The book was highly readable and incredibly insightful, and the discussions give us new ways to look at the wicked problems we encounter in our day-to-day work. The book summary presentations for each part of the book are posted below:
