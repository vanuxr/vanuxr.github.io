In late April, the VanUXR community met up at [WillowTree Vancouver](https://www.willowtreeapps.com/locations/vancouver ), where [Shenoah Plewes](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/shenoahplewes) shared a presentation of a framework to think about prioritizing efforts and activities to do research, based on decisions. We have uploaded the talk onto our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5uxlmKX73k, and you can find the Miro board template she shared here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPcJ7V8E=/?share_link_id=421176380848

In the workshop section of this event, we had the attendees try out this framework for a quite short amount of time, just to get a general sense and feel how to use it. But if you would like to chat more about how to use this framework, or share how youâ€™ve tried it out and how it worked, join our [VanUXR Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/vanuxr/shared_invite/zt-1ucggzsio-bLjORP4TG_N7LW9PEwMKRA) channel, where I have created a channel #prioritize-research-questions. (There are also many more other topics on our Slack, like the #ux-research-meetup and #jobs-gigs)

The original [meetup event link is here](https://www.meetup.com/the-vancouver-ux-research-lab/events/291701162), and if you'd like to be notified of future events like this (and more), sign up and join our [meet-up group](https://www.meetup.com/the-vancouver-ux-research-lab/).
