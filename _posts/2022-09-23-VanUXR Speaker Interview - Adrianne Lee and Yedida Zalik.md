Joining us online from [Canadian Digital Services](https://digital.canada.ca/) in Ontario this past August, was Adrianne Lee and Yedida Zalik. Their talk and workshop [Making privacy and consent forms easier to understand](https://www.meetup.com/the-vancouver-ux-research-lab/events/287285896/) was a great preposition of how a person’s participation in the research deserves to be considered and treated as its own user journey, starting with a thoughtful content design of the consent form. We asked them a few questions about themselves as professionals in this field.

## How did you get into what you are doing now?

##### Adrianne: 

I don’t have an awesome interdisciplinary story! I graduated with an industrial design degree, transitioned into UX after school, the agency I worked at focused a lot on doing user research. I got into learning about how research on an agile team is all about risk mitigation (e.g. the feedback function), learned more about methodology, the concept of “just enough” research, and found a big interest in it all. Though, I will say, I have come across many design researchers with a background in industrial design. So, maybe that played a big part!

In terms of working in civic tech, I got interested in working in government because I think government services are services that could use more feedback loops. 

##### Yedida:

I used to work in community legal aid clinics, and part of that work involved rights education. I worked on a number of collaborative projects preparing rights education in plain language. When I moved to government, I understood that I would no longer necessarily be working on rights education. But I was excited about the possibility of using content design and plain language to make government and government services more accessible to the community.

<br />

## Where do you think the field of research is headed?

##### Adrianne:

Attending a few research conferences this year, it seems like the direction is to move the focus from “serving users” to “serve your team/org/agency to better serve users” I think this shift is about understanding that you as the researcher can’t make everything happen and you need people to trust you before they can trust your expertise, action your findings, and ultimately better serve users. There’s this concept of “extending your circle of care”, which others brought up during these conferences that really resonated with me. It summarizes well how {%include pullquote.html quote="when you extend care to your organization as a whole (your teammates, other adjacent teams, other partners) you have a much better chance of extending your circle of care to the people (users) you’re trying to serve."%} 

##### Yedida:

Adrianne is best placed to answer this question. On a personal level, I hope that research can be made more accessible to the community. I think there’s an important role for research to play in assisting communities to identify accurate information.

<br />

## Who do you admire as a practitioner in this field?


##### Adrianne:

In research - Vivianne Castillo, especially what she has done with HmntyCntrd. In civic tech - honestly, the colleagues I work with and have had a chance to work with. They are some of the smartest people!

##### Yedida:

Agencies in British Columbia (your province) have done some innovative work in educating community members about government services and legal rights. Many years ago as a student, I was inspired by the work of the [People’s Law School](https://www.peopleslawschool.ca/).  Looking at their website now, I can see that they are still continuing to innovate.

<br />

## What’s a piece of research that fundamentally shifted your view(s)?

##### Adrianne:

I’m currently reading The Body Keeps Score by Bessel van der Kolk and the research presented in this book about trauma is fundamentally changing how I think about my everyday interactions with others, and others’ interactions with me.

##### Yedida:

Back in the early 2000’s I read a paper on research in Indigenous communities following principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession of the research by the communities. Hopefully this is standard practice now, but at the time, it was a fairly new approach.  

<br />

## What is a burning question on your mind nowadays?

##### Adrianne:

What are the circumstances that make “perfect the enemy of the good”? Especially in agile development, is good ever the enemy of perfect?

##### Yedida:

Can you change the system from within?
