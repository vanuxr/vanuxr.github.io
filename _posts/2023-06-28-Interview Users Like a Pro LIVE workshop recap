Last week, many UX professionals and students joined the skill-building workshop lead by Matthias Klenk and Lavanya Ashok, and learned about user interviews and mindsets, and tried them out in 15 minute sessions with “coach” volunteers. The attendees worked in groups of 3-4 to come up with a semi-structured interview script and took turns interviewing a “user”, who turned into a “coach” at the end to give them feedback on what went well and what could use improvements. The interactions among seasoned people who practice research, and attendees, made this a fun and engaging experience. (The coaches also thought it was fun being on “the other side” for a change!) The groups came together again in the end and shared observations and learning to everyone. This marks a great first-time collaboration event by Vancouver Design Check-In and VanUXR meetup.

Matthias and Lavanya’s presentation was recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/WvjAJl41A8A 

We have compiled a list of resources that goes beyond conducting the user interviews: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tcEs7RRa84f0WPkxriSXzA1CsA8xYPenzlszixPoLc/edit
You can also join the VanUXR Slack and find the #user-interviews channel to discuss more on this topic.
